# HuntTheWumpus
Console app version in .NET 6 of the HuntTheWumpus 2022 version. This includes 30 rooms, 5 cave layouts, buying secrets, and buying arrows. There are some things that are missing like Unit Testing, and having a Wumpus be lazy or active (code is there but it's not used.) Lastly, the audio I was using I pulled, so that'll have to be replaced, and about 75% of the code is written to follow  OOP and SOLID, but the GameController is where I threw a lot of code into because of the time constraint.
